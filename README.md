> Kubernetes is an open-source **container orchestration platform** that automates the **deployment**, **scaling**, and **management** of containerized applications.
> 
> Originally developed by **Google** and now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation**, it simplifies the complexities of running distributed systems by providing features such as **self-healing**, **load balancing**, and **seamless updates** without downtime.
> 
> By **grouping containers** into logical units called **pods**, Kubernetes enables developers to efficiently **manage applications** across various environments, from local machines to public clouds.
> 
> Its ability to **streamline operations** has made it the industry standard for organizations embracing **microservices** architectures and **cloud-native** development.
